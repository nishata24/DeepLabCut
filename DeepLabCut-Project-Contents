# Subdirectories

## dlc-models: contains subdirectories called test and train. Each of these subdirectories contains meta info about the parameters of the feature detectors in the config file, which is a YAML file (human-readable data serialization, converting object to a byte stream, language). 

## train: stores checkpoints, or TensorFlow snapshots, during training. These snapshots allow users to reload the trained model without re-training or picking up from a checkpoint in case training was interrupted. 

## labeled-data: stores frames used to create training dataset. If multiple videos are used to train, frames for different videos are stored in different subdirectories. 
Frames are named according to the temporal index within the video. 

## training-datasets: contains training dataset 

## videos: contains video(s) used for training (videos copied here when copy_videos=True)
To add videos to the project at any stage: deeplabcut.add_new_videos('Full path of the project configuration file', ['full path of video 4', 'full path of video 5'], copy_videos=True/False)

# Config File

## Parameters set during Project Creation: task, scorer, date, project_path, video_sets
These parameters are NOT to be changed (besides video_sets because videos can be added or removed)

## Parameters to Edit after Project Creation: bodyparts, numframes2pick, colormap, dotsize, alphavalue, iteration, start, stop

## Bodyparts: shouldnâ€™t be changed after labeling frames and saving labels

## Alphavalue: transparency of plotted labels

## Iteration: keeps count of iterations used to create training set, should NOT be changed
start/stop: used to designate over which interval frames should be extracted for long videos

## Parameters for Neural Network Training: TrainingFraction, resnet
## TrainingFraction: 2 digit floating point number (ranges from 0-1) to split the dataset into training and testing sets
## Resnet: specifies which pre-trained model to use (choose b/w 50 or 101)
## Parameters for Video Analysis: batch_size, snapshotindex, p-cutoff, cropping, x1, x2, y1, y2
## Batch_size: how many frames to process at once during inference
Smaller - smaller gradient updates
Larger - larger gradient updates

## Snapshotindex: specifies checkpoint to be used for evaluation.
Snapshots refer to stored TensorFlow configuration that holds weights of feature detectors 

## P-cutoff: threshold of the likelihood and helps distinguishing likely body parts from uncertain ones (higher is better)

## Parameters for Refinement: move2corner, corner2move2

## Move2corner: binary parameter to make sure points predicted beyond the image are mapped to a user defined point within the image so that the label can be manually moved to the correct location

## Corner2move2: target location is move2corner=True
